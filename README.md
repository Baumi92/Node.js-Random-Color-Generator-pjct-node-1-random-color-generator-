# Node.js Random Color Generator

Generates a block of approximately 31x9 '#' characters of a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000) when a person enters a specific command in the command line.

It also accepts requests for a:

- hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
- luminosity (e.g. light or dark)

and then generate random colors that match those choices.
